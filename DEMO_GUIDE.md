# 🎯 Demo Guide for Synapse Mapper

A comprehensive guide for demonstrating Synapse Mapper at your hackathon.

## 🚀 Pre-Demo Checklist

### 1. Setup & Test (Do This Before Your Demo Slot!)

```bash
# Run setup script
./setup.sh

# Test backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m app.main
# Visit http://localhost:8000 - should see {"status": "online"}

# Test frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev

```

### 2. Prepare Sample PDFs

**Option A: Find Real Papers**
- Search PubMed Central for open-access biomedical papers
- Download 2-5 PDFs on related topics (e.g., cancer research, COVID-19, drug discovery)
- Keep them under 10MB each for fast processing

**Option B: Sample Topics That Work Well**
- Immunotherapy research
- CRISPR gene editing
- Alzheimer's disease
- Drug-disease interactions
- COVID-19 treatments

### 3. Practice Run
Do a complete run-through:
1. Upload PDFs → 2. Wait for processing → 3. Explore graph → 4. Show analytics → 5. Export

**Target timing:** 3-5 minutes total

## 🎤 Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
> "Hi! I'm [name] and this is **Synapse Mapper** - it transforms biomedical research papers into interactive knowledge graphs. Instead of reading through hundreds of pages, researchers can visually explore connections between genes, diseases, and treatments."

### Problem Statement (30 seconds)
> "The challenge: A typical drug discovery researcher has to review dozens of papers to understand how different genes, proteins, and chemicals interact. This is time-consuming and it's easy to miss connections across different papers."

### Solution Overview (45 seconds)
> "Synapse Mapper solves this by:
> 1. Automatically extracting biomedical entities using scispaCy
> 2. Identifying relationships between them
> 3. Building an interactive graph you can explore
> 
> It uses FastAPI on the backend for processing and React with force-directed graphs on the frontend for visualization."

### Live Demo (2-3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Upload (20 seconds)
- Drag & drop your prepared PDFs
- Mention: "Supporting multiple PDFs at once"
- Check "Enable AI-Powered Extraction" if you have API keys configured
- Click "Generate Knowledge Graph"

#### Step 2: Processing (30 seconds - TALK WHILE IT PROCESSES!)
> "While it's processing, here's what's happening:
> - **Text extraction** from PDFs using PyMuPDF
> - **Named Entity Recognition** with scispaCy to identify genes, chemicals, diseases
> - **Relationship extraction** using co-occurrence and pattern matching
> - **Graph building** with NetworkX for analytics
> 
> The progress bar shows real-time status from our background job queue."

#### Step 3: Graph Visualization (60 seconds)
**Once loaded:**
- **Zoom out** to show full graph
  > "Each node represents a biomedical entity, color-coded by type: blue for genes, green for chemicals, red for diseases."

- **Click a node** to show focus mode
  > "When I click a node, it highlights connected entities and shows the evidence sentences from the papers."

- **Hover over an edge**
  > "Hovering over connections shows the actual sentence from the research paper that mentions both entities."

- **Toggle to 3D** (if confident with controls)
  > "We can switch to 3D for a more immersive view - great for exploring large graphs."

#### Step 4: Filtering & Analytics (45 seconds)
- Open sidebar filters
  > "We can filter by entity type, minimum connections, or search for specific terms."

- Click "View Analytics"
  > "The analytics dashboard shows:
  > - Entity distribution across types
  > - Most central nodes (key concepts)
  > - Community detection - groups of related concepts
  > - Graph statistics"

#### Step 5: Export (15 seconds)
- Click Export button
  > "Finally, you can export the graph as JSON for further analysis, CSV for spreadsheets, or PNG for publications."

### Technical Highlights (30 seconds)
> "Key technical features:
> - **Backend:** FastAPI with async processing, scispaCy for biomedical NER
> - **Frontend:** React with WebGL-powered force-directed graphs
> - **Optional LLM integration** for semantic relationship understanding
> - **Scalable:** Handles hundreds of nodes with smooth 60 FPS rendering"

### Impact & Use Cases (30 seconds)
> "This helps researchers:
> - **Accelerate literature review** from days to minutes
> - **Discover hidden connections** across papers
> - **Generate hypotheses** for new drug targets
> - **Visualize complex relationships** in an intuitive way"

### Closing (15 seconds)
> "Synapse Mapper turns static PDFs into an interactive research tool. We'd love to show you more - any questions?"

## 🎨 Demo Tips

### Visual Impact
1. **Start with 2-3 PDFs** - Fast processing, manageable graph size
2. **Use 3D view** for "wow factor" when appropriate
3. **Have a backup** - Pre-generated graph JSON in case of issues
4. **Dark mode** looks great on projectors
5. **Zoom animations** are smooth - use them!

### Smooth Delivery
- **Practice the timing** - 5 minutes goes fast!
- **Talk during processing** - Dead air is boring
- **Have fallback explanations** - If something breaks, explain what would happen
- **Know your data** - Understand what entities are in your sample PDFs

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Processing takes too long**
- Use smaller PDFs (< 20 pages each)
- Process 2-3 PDFs max for demos
- Have a pre-generated graph ready

**Issue: Graph is too cluttered**
- Apply filters immediately after loading
- Start with minimum degree = 2
- Focus on one entity type at a time

**Issue: Backend/Frontend not connecting**
- Check both servers are running
- Verify CORS settings
- Show the backend API docs at `/docs` as backup

**Issue: PDF has no entities**
- Use biomedical papers (not general news)
- PubMed Central papers work best
- Have 2-3 backup PDFs ready

## 🎯 Answering Common Questions

**Q: How accurate is the entity recognition?**
> "We use scispaCy's en_core_sci_lg model, trained on 600k+ biomedical papers. It achieves ~85% F1 score on entity recognition. We filter low-confidence extractions and require entities to appear at least twice."

**Q: Can it scale to hundreds of papers?**
> "Yes! The backend uses async processing and job queues. For very large corpora, we recommend filtering to top-N nodes or by entity type. We've tested with up to 50 PDFs successfully."

**Q: What about false connections?**
> "Co-occurrence can create false positives. That's why we show the evidence sentences - researchers can verify connections. The optional LLM enhancement adds semantic understanding to reduce false positives."

**Q: Could this work for other domains?**
> "Absolutely! The architecture is domain-agnostic. You'd swap out scispaCy for a different NER model. The graph visualization and analytics would work the same."

**Q: What's next for this project?**
> "Future enhancements:
> - Real-time collaboration features
> - Integration with PubMed API for automatic paper fetching
> - More sophisticated relationship types
> - Temporal analysis (tracking research evolution)
> - Export to Cytoscape/Gephi formats"

4. **Show pre-generated export** files (JSON/CSV)
5. **Explain the architecture** with whiteboard/slides

## 🌟 Memorable Closing Lines
